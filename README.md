## Installation

I have fixed the log reading issue and created a initilization flow to store your bags as a initial state. This then keeps track of your map materials consumed and compares against item drops for accurate earnings.

When you discover a drop item that doesn't exist in id_table.conf or prices have significantly changed, you can submit an ISSUE or send a PUSH after making changes. Thank you
